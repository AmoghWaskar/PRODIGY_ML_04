# Dataset Folder

This folder is intended to store the dataset used for training and evaluating the Hand Gesture Recognition model.

## Why the Dataset is Not Uploaded

The dataset used in this project (LeapGestRecog) exceeds GitHub's file size limits.  
Due to repository size restrictions and best practices, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Including large datasets in GitHub repositories is not recommended because:
- GitHub limits file uploads to 100MB per file
- Large repositories become slow to clone
- It increases storage and bandwidth usage
