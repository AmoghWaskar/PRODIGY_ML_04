# Visuals / Outputs

This folder contains visual results generated during model training, evaluation, and testing.

These outputs help in understanding model performance and validating predictions.

---

## Contents

The folder may include:

- Training vs Validation Accuracy plots
- Training vs Validation Loss plots
- Confusion Matrix visualization
- Sample prediction results
- Real-time gesture detection screenshots
- Model evaluation charts

---

## Purpose

The visuals in this directory are used to:

- Analyze model learning behavior
- Evaluate classification performance
- Identify misclassifications
- Demonstrate real-time prediction results
- Present results in reports, GitHub, and LinkedIn

---


---

## How These Were Generated

The visualizations were created using:

- Matplotlib for plots
- Seaborn for confusion matrix heatmap
- Scikit-learn for classification report
- OpenCV for real-time detection output

---

## Note

These files are generated artifacts and may vary depending on:
- Training epochs
- Model architecture
- Dataset split
- Hyperparameter tuning

If not present, you can regenerate them by running the evaluation notebook or script.

## Recommended Usage

These visuals can be used for:

- Project documentation
- Portfolio demonstration
- Technical presentations
- Performance comparison studies
